# Genetic-Algorithm-Simple
Code for a simple genetic algorithm in Python

Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

* Initial population
* Fitness function
* Selection
* Crossover
* Mutation


### Pseudocode ###

```START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover    
    Mutation    
    Compute fitness    
UNTIL population has converged
STOP 
```
